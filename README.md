# Quick introduction to Computer Vision
### What is Computer Vision?
Computer Vision is a field in Computer Science that focuses on giving computers the ability to see the visual world like the human eye does. The computers achieve this through acquiring, processing and analyzing the digital images and videos with the aim to extract meaningful information from the visual world. 
### A brief history of Computer Vision
The journey of Computer Vision started in the 1960s with the idea of giving computers the ability to mimic human vision and then ask them what they see. In 1966 the first milestone in the journey of artificially intelligent Computer Vision was reached when a camera was attached to a computer and then the computer was asked to describe what it saw.

In 1970 the foundations of the computer algorithms that exist today were formed which could extract edges from images, labeling of lines, motion estimation and optical flow.
